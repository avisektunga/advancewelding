            <h2>Theory Part A: An Introduction to Welding</h2>
            <h3>What is Welding?</h3>
            <p>At its core, welding is a fabrication process that joins materials, usually metals or thermoplastics, by using high heat to melt the parts together and allowing them to cool, causing fusion. Think of it as using a localized, high-powered "glue" that is as strong as, or even stronger than, the original material. Welding is different from lower-temperature joining techniques like soldering and brazing, which do not melt the base metal.</p>
            
            <h3>Why is Welding Important?</h3>
            <p>Welding is the backbone of modern construction and manufacturing. Without it, we wouldn't have skyscrapers, cars, airplanes, ships, bridges, or pipelines. It is essential for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Construction:</strong> Creating the steel frameworks for buildings and bridges.</li>
                <li><strong>Automotive Industry:</strong> Assembling car bodies and frames.</li>
                <li><strong>Aerospace:</strong> Building aircraft and spacecraft where joint strength is critical.</li>
                <li><strong>Manufacturing:</strong> Creating everything from home appliances to industrial machinery.</li>
                <li><strong>Repairs:</strong> Fixing broken metal parts, extending the life of equipment.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Basic Welding Principles</h3>
            <p>Every welding process involves three key things:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>A Heat Source:</strong> To melt the material. This can be an electric arc, a gas flame, a laser, or even friction.</li>
                <li><strong>Filler Material (Optional):</strong> Often, a "filler" wire or rod is added to the molten pool to create a stronger joint. Some processes join the base metals directly without filler.</li>
                <li><strong>Shielding:</strong> The molten weld pool is extremely reactive to the surrounding air (especially oxygen and nitrogen). If exposed, the weld can become brittle and weak. Shielding protects the weld pool using either a gas (like Argon or CO2) or a "flux," which melts to form a protective slag layer over the weld.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3>Basic Safety in Welding</h3>
            <p>Welding can be hazardous if proper precautions are not taken. The intense heat and light from the welding arc can cause severe burns and "arc eye," a painful eye condition. Therefore, proper Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is non-negotiable. This includes a welding helmet, flame-resistant clothing, leather gloves, and proper ventilation.</p>

            <h2>Theory Part B: Joint Design & Preparation</h2>
            <h3>What is Weld Joint Design and Why is it Important?</h3>
            <p>Before a single spark is struck, the success of a weld is determined by how the metal pieces are prepared and arranged. <strong>Joint design</strong> is the process of defining the shape and dimensions of the edges of the materials to be joined.</p>
            <p>Proper joint design ensures:</p>
             <ul>
                <li><strong>Strength:</strong> The weld is as strong as, or stronger than, the base metal.</li>
                <li><strong>Complete Penetration:</strong> The weld metal fuses through the entire thickness of the joint, leaving no gaps.</li>
                <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> The welder has enough physical space to manipulate the torch or electrode to create a sound weld.</li>
                <li><strong>Cost-Effectiveness:</strong> Using the right joint design avoids wasting filler metal and time.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>The Five Basic Types of Weld Joints</h3>
            <p><em>(It is highly recommended to find simple diagrams for these joints to add to your site).</em></p>
            <p><strong>1. Butt Joint:</strong> The two pieces of metal are placed in the same plane, with their edges meeting end-to-end. This is common for welding plates and pipes.</p>
            <p><strong>2. Lap Joint:</strong> The two pieces of metal overlap each other. The weld is typically placed along the edge of one or both pieces.</p>
            <p><strong>3. T-Joint (or Tee Joint):</strong> The edge of one piece is welded to the surface of another piece at a 90-degree angle, forming a "T" shape. Used for frames and structural parts.</p>
            <p><strong>4. Corner Joint:</strong> The corners of two pieces are joined, forming an "L" shape. Used for building boxes, tanks, and frames.</p>
            <p><strong>5. Edge Joint:</strong> The edges of two (or more) pieces are placed side-by-side, and the common edges are welded together. Generally used for thin materials.</p>

            <h3>Types of Welds (Edge Preparation)</h3>
            <p>For thicker materials, the edges must be shaped to create a groove for the weld metal to fill. Common preparations include V-Groove, Double V-Groove (forming an "X" shape), and U-Groove designs.</p>
