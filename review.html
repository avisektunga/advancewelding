            <h2>Theory: An Introduction to Welding</h2>
            <h3>What is Welding?</h3>
            <p>At its core, welding is a fabrication process that joins materials, usually metals or thermoplastics, by using high heat to melt the parts together and allowing them to cool, causing fusion. Think of it as using a localized, high-powered "glue" that is as strong as, or even stronger than, the original material. Welding is different from lower-temperature joining techniques like soldering and brazing, which do not melt the base metal.</p>
            
            <h3>Why is Welding Important?</h3>
            <p>Welding is the backbone of modern construction and manufacturing. Without it, we wouldn't have skyscrapers, cars, airplanes, ships, bridges, or pipelines. It is essential for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Construction:</strong> Creating the steel frameworks for buildings and bridges.</li>
                <li><strong>Automotive Industry:</strong> Assembling car bodies and frames.</li>
                <li><strong>Aerospace:</strong> Building aircraft and spacecraft where joint strength is critical.</li>
                <li><strong>Manufacturing:</strong> Creating everything from home appliances to industrial machinery.</li>
                <li><strong>Repairs:</strong> Fixing broken metal parts, extending the life of equipment.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Basic Welding Principles</h3>
            <p>Every welding process involves three key things:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>A Heat Source:</strong> To melt the material. This can be an electric arc, a gas flame, a laser, or even friction.</li>
                <li><strong>Filler Material (Optional):</strong> Often, a "filler" wire or rod is added to the molten pool to create a stronger joint. Some processes join the base metals directly without filler.</li>
                <li><strong>Shielding:</strong> The molten weld pool is extremely reactive to the surrounding air (especially oxygen and nitrogen). If exposed, the weld can become brittle and weak. Shielding protects the weld pool using either a gas (like Argon or CO2) or a "flux," which melts to form a protective slag layer over the weld.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3>Basic Safety in Welding</h3>
            <p>Welding can be hazardous if proper precautions are not taken. The intense heat and light from the welding arc can cause severe burns and "arc eye," a painful eye condition. Therefore, proper Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is non-negotiable. This includes a welding helmet, flame-resistant clothing, leather gloves, and proper ventilation.</p>
